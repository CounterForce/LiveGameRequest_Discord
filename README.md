Request a cs:go players current live match via Discord bot.  

:warning: | **WARNING: THIS PROJECT IS NOT OPERATIONAL** 
:---: | :---
> Valve has removed the ability to request a user's live match. For this reason, the project does not work in its current state!  
> See this issue for updates on this topic: https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-globaloffensive/issues/59

Currently, the bot allows only one operation at a time and logs in and out of Steam for every single request. A much better approach would be logging into Steam once and just refreshing the game coordinator connection if needed.  

This is an old project requested by a customer that was written relatively quickly and uncleanly.  
I made this project public because I had the code just lying around.

## Updating
In most cases, files only need to be overwritten, renamed or moved, but this project has **no guaranteed backward compatibility** and if the file structure changes during an update, a local installation must be manually adjusted. The only files that will remain compatible at all times are database files if not otherwise stated.

## Configuration
```Javascript
{
    "Discord": {
        "botToken": "DISCORD BOT TOKEN",
        "botChannel": "DISCORD CHANNEL ID",
        "botPrefix": "!",
        "botCommand": "check",
        "accessRole": ""
    },
    "Steam": {
        "username": "STEAM USERNAME",
        "password": "STEAM PASSWORD",
        "sharedSecret": "STEAM ACCOUNT SECRET",
        "apiKey": "STEAM API KEY"
    },
    "Customization": {
        "tTag": "ðŸ”´",
        "ctTag": "ðŸ”µ"
    }
}
```

- `accessRole` is optional. If empty, everybody is allowed to use commands.

## Usage
#### Adding Profiles
- Use `!check <steamID64|profileURL>` to check live games for a specific Steam user
  - Examples:
    - `!check 12345678912345678`
	- `!check http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/12345678912345678`
    - `!check https://steamcommunity.com/id/customURL`

To get the steamID64 or URL of a profile you can use websites like [STEAMID I/O](https://steamid.io/).  

## Additional Information
### Retrieve your Discord Channel ID
In order to retrieve a unique Discord Channel ID, do as follows:
- Open your Discord Settings and click on the **Appearance** tab.
- In this tab, enable `Developer Mode`.
